## Bubble Sort:-
The name is so called as - When you drop a heavier object in the water, bubbles with come up.
Similarly, the heavier element will go down and the lighter elements(bubble) will come up.

### Analysis for n elements-
* Number of passes =  (n-1)
* Number of comparison = n(n-1)/2 = 0(n2)
* Number of swaps = 0(n2)

For 'k' passes you get k sorted elements.
So if you want largest elements, perform  1 pass. if you want 3 largest elements, perform  3 pass.
